**🐍 Snake Game with Pygame**

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** using Python and the Pygame library. It’s a great beginner-friendly project for learning how to handle game loops, user input, collision detection, and graphics in Python.

**🎮 Game Description**

In this game, you control a green snake using your keyboard’s arrow keys. The goal is to eat red blocks (food) that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

When the game ends, you can press:
* `C` to play again
* `Q` to quit

**📦 Requirements**
* Python 3.x
* Pygame

You can install Pygame using:
pip install pygame

**🕹️ Controls**
* Arrow Keys: Move the snake (Left, Right, Up, Down)
* C: Restart the game
* Q: Quit the game

This project is perfect for beginners learning game development with Python!
